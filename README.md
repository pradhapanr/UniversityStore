# University Store

This project was made in my second year at the University of Guelph. It represents a very basic user interface for
what would be a store to purchase essential products at a university, like electronics or textbooks. This project was
written in Java with emphasis placed on utilising major object oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation,
polymorphism, and inheritance.

The user interface is created with Java Swing and is made with a list of fucntions that allow a user to import a text file
with formatted data that contains products that they would wish to list on the marketplace. As the list changes with purchases
or new addition, that file is constantly updated, and can be saved and exported whenever possible using the menu bar as well.
